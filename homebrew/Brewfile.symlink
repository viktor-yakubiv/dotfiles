# Terminal
#
# I have used iTerm for long time. When MacOS introduced automatic
# light/dirk appearance â€” my favourite feature of long time,
# iTerm did not support it, so I switched to default Terminal.
# When I started using Neovim, it did not work quite well with
# the Apple's Terminal, and I started using iTerm Beta 3.5 that supported
# syncing with system appearance. At some point, I got annoyed configuring
# iTerm and looked for alternatives.
#
# Now, I use Wezterm. It is configured in Lua and with 40 lines of code
# I could get far more than with endless hours of checking iTerm's UI.

# I used to have oh-my-zsh. However, recently I have discovered that I do not

# Neovim
#
# My primary editor.
#
# I have started my journey from Notepad++. Then, I have tried all
# the things: Atom, Breakets, Lapce. They didn't work for me.
#
# I have been using JetBrains' IDEs for a while in the university
# but suddenly moved to Sublime Text as it was faster, provided everything
# I needed and was significantly more energy-efficient, so I could work
# all day long on a battery. I have used Sublime Text for five years.
# Even when everybody was talking that VS Code is de-facto standard
# in front-end development, I was concerned about applications
# using browser as an engine; due to the same energy-efficiency reason.
# I was especially happy with Sublime Text v4.
#
# Yet, I have decided to learn Neovim at the end of 2022,
# and it is the best editor so far. I was familiar with Vim key bindings
# but Sublime's Vintage mode was never handy for me. The same situation was
# with any other GUI editor and Vim extension (VS Code, Lapce).
# Neovim can be cofigured ultimately with Lua and extended endlessly
# with tons of open source plugins. I definitely recommend!
# 
# NOTE: As a Mac user, I miss nice GUI but this is the best option so far.
